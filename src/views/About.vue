              Each year, a new graduating class from Perry has the opportunity
              to leave PHS and further their education by attending an
              accredited university. However, this opportunity is threatened as
              the sticker price on collegiate programs continues to rise and
              federal support is reduced. Fortunately, each year a new class of
              Perry alumni graduates from universities across the nation and
              enters the workforce. To support current high school students who
              have the academic prowess to attend college but lack the financial
              resources to do so, we have created the Late Night Scholarships
              fund.

              Registered with the Ohio Secretary of State and the IRS as a
              501(c)(3) exempt non-profit, Late Night Scholarships was created
              to organize Perry alumni who want to directly support Perry
              students seeking financial assistance to attend college.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Late Night Scholarships is officially a non-profit
              organization, it functions more as a community of alumni
              philanthropists supporting young intellectuals. Each of the donors
              involved in the fund collaborates to manage the scholarship
              process. By donating as little as $5, donors have the option to
              read the anonymized applications and vote for which applicants
              should receive the scholarships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, each donor is welcome to propose improvements to the
              applications. In the future, we hope to provide mentorship
              opportunities to applicants by matching students with donors based
              on their career aspirations. In 2023, we awarded scholarships of
              $1,500 to 3 graduating PHS seniors. The hope is that as more alumni
              graduate from college, the donor base will continue to grow and
              help us provide more scholarships with larger balances.
